# VT-TWO

VT-TWO is a PIC24 vased VT-220 Terminal emulator based on an Arduino style shield.
VT-TWO generates a bit-bashed composite video signal for a 80x24 character based
display on a standard television and interfaces with a PS/2 compatible USB keyboard
to recieve user input. 

## Status

Basic VT-220 controls and PAL generation are working. The code supports normal and
bold characters with inverse video and blinking.
